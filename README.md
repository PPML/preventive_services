Public repository for the manuscript "Use of no-cost preventive services jeopardized by Kennedy v. Braidwood"

## Data Sharing 
The analytic datasets used in this manuscript are not publicly available but were accessed by the authors under a restricted data use agreement between Stanford University and Merative. Code for both the cohort assembly and analysis are centrally stored and archived on the Stanford University Center for Population Health Sciences data portal. Investigators wishing to replicate this work should complete requirements to obtain MarketScan data access and request view-access to the project from bronsm@stanford.edu, including code and workflow. 

## Workflow
The analysis was conducted in the Redivis platform in collaboration with the Stanford Center for Population Health Sciences organization. In this repo, we provide
- the SQL code and process used to identify service recipients for 1 of the 10 preventive services studied
- the [National Drug Codes for the 3 preventive medications](https://github.com/PPML/preventive_services/blob/main/medication_codes.xlsx)
